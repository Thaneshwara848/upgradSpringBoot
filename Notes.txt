		JDK(java Development Kit ) :
			we can develop and we can RUN also 
			JDK = JRE + some lib 

		JRE : java Run time Env 
			we can not developet but we can only run 
				
		JVM : java virtual machin

Oops: 
	Inheritance  
			Acquiring the property from parent to child class
				Advantage : 
						reduce the no of line 
						Increase  the app performance  
						we can Re use 
			// parent --- super ----- base class  
			// child ---- sub --------- Derived class

			Super : it is used to Access the parent properties 
			Extends keywords : it used to call/ import  the parent propertie73
			Single level 
			Multi  level
			Hierarchical
			Hybrid 	: not support  : ambiguity/ Dimond  problem 
			Multiple : not support : ambiguity/  problem
			 
	Polymorphism 	: 	same method but diff behavior 
				Same method name  + diff parameter + 
				it refers to the ability of a single method or class to take on multiple forms.

		Types of Polymorphism
			Compile-time Polymorphism 
				(Method Overloading):is type of polymorphism is resolved during compile time.
					Constructor over loading 
					method over loading  
			Runtime Polymorphism 
				(Method Overriding):This type of polymorphism is resolved during runtime
					Method over riding 

		Access Modifier
				Public  : anywhere ? same package  / same class / other class / other package 
				private : only in same class 
				protected : anywhere in same package  + sub class in other packages 
				default   : anywhere in only same package 

		NON Access Modifier : 
					Static , final , Abstract 

			// FINAL  keyword 				
				// Variable	: we cant modify  
				// method 	: we cant over ride 
				// class 	: we can not inherit 

			//Static  keyword 
					// static : NO need of CREATING OBJ : directly  WE can access
						how to Access ? 
					// A.variable 
					// A.methodname

	Abstraction 		
	Encapsulation 


SQL 


						JAVA 
Basics : 
		Data Types
		Operators
		Conditions 
Oops : 
		Inheritance 	: acquiring the property from Parent to Child 
		Polymorphism 	: one methods can behave with Multiple ways 
		Abstraction 	: hiding the Implementation just by showing the functionality  to End user
		Encapsulation 	: hiding the data member into a single unit / single class 
Access Modifier : 			
		Public  : anywhere ? same package  / same class / other class / other package 
		private : only in same class 
		protected : anywhere in same package  + sub class in other packages 
		Default   : anywhere in only same package 
	
Non Acc Modifier : keywords 
		static 	: it belongs to class but not object ( no need to Create to obj , directly we can access  )
		Final 	: it will restrict us  to access (var(no modification ) , method (no Overid)  , class (no inheriatnece)) 
		Abstract : Hiding the implementation 


		Super 	: it refers to parent class variable 
		This :  refer to current class variable s
		extends : it is use to Access the property from parent to child 
		



Abstract : 
		Hiding the Implementation 
			make a methods as Abstract 
			How may Ways we can hide ? 
				2 ways ? 
					1 ) Using Abstract class 
					2 ) Using INTERAFCE 


	Class 					Abstract class 						Interface

1 ) class {}					abstract class X{}					interface I {}

2 ) can have only non abstract 			both abstract + non abstract 				will have only abstract methods 	

3 ) A a = new A();OBJ ? yes 			No 							No 

4) int a  ; 	 yes 				yes 							No (int a=100)

5) A() {}  we can have constructor 		yes we can  have 					no  we cant have a constructor 

6 ) 0 % security 				0 -100%							100% y ? bcz by default all abstract

7 ) Multiple inheritance ?  no 			No 							yes

	== it will check the reference 
	. equals : it will the check the content

	String 						String Buffer 					String Builder 

	Im mutable 					Mutable 					later i'll explain 

	we cant change the value 			we can change 
	name ="Thanesh";				design ="Developer";

Single Threaded : 
		Execute one task a time 

MULTITHREADING : 

		Multiple Thread can Execute at a time 
		Multiple Thread can execute parallelly  
		Multiple Thread can execute Concurrently  
		
	Ex : a web Server can handle the many clients request at a time 

	Process : Restaurant 
	Thread  : Waiter ( Each Waiter can server a different costumer at a time  )

	Railway : 
	Single Thread : only one train can go at a time (Single line )
	Multiline  : many trains can  move in parallel 

	how many ways we can achieve the Threading : 
		1) By Extending the Thread class 
			1) Each class much have to extends Thread class 
			2) must have a call using the start methods 
			3) Must have to Over ride the run methods 
		2) By implementing the Runnable Interface 

			1) Each class much have to implements the Runnable (Interface )
			2) must have a call using the start methods 
			3) Must have to Over ride the run methods 

	Thread Life Cycle : 
	many methods : 
		Start , run , Suspend , Resume  , Stop , Wait , notify , Sleep , Thread.CurrentThread,
		SetName ,getName , SetPriority ,getPriority
		synchronized 



COLLECTION CRUD LINK : https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Xz76CftWym/
Collections : 
		List	: 
			ArrayList 
			LinkedList			
			Vector
			Stack   
		Set 
			hashSet
			LinkedHashSet
			TreeSet 
		Map 	
			hashTable
			hashMap 
			Linkedhashmap 
			TreeMap


		Stream API ---> 
				Data Processing 
it is not so easy to write the codes for even some common data processing operations 
	such as filtering, sorting, matching, finding, mapping etc.
	 That’s why Java API designers have come up with Stream API in Java 8 to implement 
			more complex data processing logics with the least number of lines of code.

			List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Thanesh","Geetha","Ashwani","Bharath","Thanesh");
						Print
						print the record whose name is Starting with G
						print the record and convert to UpperCase 
						print the record and convert to LowerCase
						print only unique names  
						remove the duplicate names 
						sort the names 
						sorting --- print top 3 records
						skip top 2 
						
						
						
			
JDBC : JAVA to Database 
		5 Steps ) 
				1 ) load the Driver 			: based on the database we have to load the driver 
									: based on the we have to add the dependency from the maven Repo
				2 ) Establish the Connection 		: we have to setup connection , by add the url , username , password 
				3 ) Create the Statement 		: we have to pass the query's based o the Requirement 
									: insert 	: PraperStatemt  stmt= con.prepareStatement("insert into emp vales(?,?,?)");
									: delete 	: delete from emp where id = ? 
									: update	: update emp set  salary = ? where id = ?
									: Read		: ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("Select * from employee");
				4 ) Execute the Statement 		: Execute 
				5 ) Close the connection 		: con.close();

	Oops  : Inheritance , Polymorphism , Abstraction , Encapsulation 
	Access Modifiers  :  public , private , protected , default 
	Non Access Modifiers : final  , static , abstract 
	Exception handling  : both check exception & unchecked Exception , and custom exception also 
	Collections : LIST , SET , MAP , 
	JDBC 		: java to Data base Connectivity 
Spring boot: 
	Web 
	Rest :(Web Services  ) : Rest full web services 
		HTTP methods : APis Buildings 
		@Get Mapping 
		@Post mapping
		@Delete Mapping
		@Put Mapping
		@PathVariable
		@Requestand Response Body 
						POST MAN tool : / it is APi testing tool 
	Layard Architecture 
			Controller	: it will communicate from the View and model  (MVC ) (M : model , V : view , C : Controller) 
			Service		: it meant for the to write the business logic  	
			Repo 		: it is used to communicate from the database 
			model 		: based on the model ,it will create a schema of the table 
			Exception 	: if something went wrong with the data m then we can raise exceptions 

	Data JPA : find All, Find By Id  , Save , Delete, Delete All  , Update , etc...!many 
			@Entity, @Id , @Column , @Table , @Tranisent , 
	Lombok : to reduce the boiler plate code , @Data , @AllArgCOnt , @noArgCost, @toString,  
	Swagger  : Browser APi Testing , and it will document all out APIs 
	Spring Boot Exception Handler  : Goble Exception handler 
	Validation  : its is used to validate the use input , if the data is correct then it will allow us to insert the record 
			@NotBlank, @notNull, @Min, @Max, @pattern , @Size , @Email , @Valid, 
	Mockito
	JSP 
	Security 
	 
	
	
	
				before insert the record it will check and then if everything is correct then it will insert 
	@Entity
	@Table(name="Employees")
	Employee
		@Id : primary key 
		@generatedvalue(strategy=AUTO)
		ID 
		
		@Colume(name="username")
		@notnull(message="name must be required")
		@Pattern(reg="A-Za-z" , message="name is invalid ")
		NAME 
		
		@notBlank
